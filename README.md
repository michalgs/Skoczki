# Skoczki: The Game
A simple console game implemented in Haskell.

You can check its rules in Polish under the following link:

## Note:
If you're using Windows, I suggest running `chcp 65001` in the terminal or using __WSL__. This is due to issues with UTF-8 formatting in the default command prompt, which affects the display of chess pieces.
